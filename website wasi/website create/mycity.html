Ranked as a beta-global city,[21][22] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[23] with an estimated GDP of $164 billion (PPP) as of 2019.[16][17] Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[24] as well as one of Pakistan's most secular and socially liberal cities.[25][26][27] With its location on the Arabian Sea, Karachi serves as a transport hub, and is home to Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Bin Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[28]

                The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.

                The British East India Company captured Karachi on 3 February 1839 after HMS Wellesley opened fire and quickly destroyed Manora Fort, which guarded Karachi Harbour at Manora Point.[92] Karachi's population at the time was an estimated 8,000 to 14,000,[93] and was confined to the walled city in Mithadar, with suburbs in what is now the Serai Quarter.[94] British troops, known as the "Company Bahadur" established a camp to the east of the captured city, which became the precursor to the modern Karachi Cantonment. The British further developed the Karachi Cantonment as a military garrison to aid the British war effort in the First Anglo-Afghan War.[95]
